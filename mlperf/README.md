# MLPerf Containers

WIP

There are apptainer recipes to build and pull the MLPerf containers used in [NVIDIA's Measuring Training and Inferencing Performance on NVIDIA AI Platforms guide (ver 21.09)](https://developer.nvidia.com/deep-learning-performance-training-inference/Measuring_Training_and_Inferencing_Performance_on_NVIDIA_AI_Platforms.pdf).

`customized_scripts` will also contain scripts, originally from [NVIDIA's DeepLearning examples](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples), used to download the data. The customizations are those instructed in the guide, as well as adapting the instructions for Apptainer and installation dependency fixes.
